        "Fast. Simple. Reliable.": "",
        "MiniOS is a lightweight and fast Linux distribution that runs directly from a USB drive. Based on Debian, it inherits its stability and rich software repository. MiniOS is an excellent choice for creating a mobile workstation, developing specialized systems, or getting to know Linux.": "",
        "A key feature of MiniOS is its modular architecture. You get a basic set of modules and can easily remove, disable, or create your own, customizing the system for specific tasks. This flexibility allows you to build highly specialized configurations, achieving maximum performance by eliminating unnecessary components and integrating the necessary ones. The process of module management is simplified thanks to built-in tools.": "",
        "Live mode allows you to work with MiniOS without installing it on a hard disk, while preserving user data and settings. EFI and Legacy BIOS support guarantees compatibility with almost any device. Most popular utilities including Ventoy, Rufus and balenaEtcher are suitable for creating a bootable flash drive.": "",
        "MiniOS Standard is a compact operating system designed for everyday tasks. It is characterized by high performance and a concise but effective interface. The system includes basic graphical programs and necessary console utilities. The functionality can be extended by installing additional programs using the APT package manager from the extensive Debian repository.": "",
