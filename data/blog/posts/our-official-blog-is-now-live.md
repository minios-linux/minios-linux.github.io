  Hello, friends!


  Our website currently receives over 1,500 unique daily visits, and this number
  is growing every month. We've already come a long way to improving your MiniOS
  experience: in addition to a simple page where you can get initial information
  about the system and download distributions, we now have
  [documentation](https://minios.dev/docs). We've filled this section with
  detailed articles covering virtually every technical aspect of working with
  the system.

Hello, friends!

Our website currently receives over 1,500 unique daily visits, and this number is growing every month. We've already come a long way to improving your MiniOS experience: in addition to a simple page where you can get initial information about the system and download distributions, we now have [documentation](https://minios.dev/docs). We've filled this section with detailed articles covering virtually every technical aspect of working with the system.

Now it's time for more direct interaction—we're officially launching this blog. We'll publish the latest news, in-depth analytics, and informative articles here. And most importantly, you can now share your feedback and impressions in the comments section.

However, while analyzing our traffic, we've noticed an interesting trend. Despite the high user engagement on the website, our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/minios_news) remains unfairly overlooked. Many users simply download the ISO image and leave, unaware that our project's core activities take place there.

Want to be the first to know about new MiniOS versions as soon as they're built? Want to participate in testing and influence new features through community surveys? Then you definitely need to subscribe.

Join us—our community is growing every day!
